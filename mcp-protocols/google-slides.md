## Overview
This file dictates how Gemini interacts with Google Slides via the MCP.

### 1. Slide Creation & Structure
When creating presentations, utilize appropriate slide layouts (Title, Title and Body, Blank, etc.) to ensure a consistent and professional design.

### 2. Content Placement
When adding text, shapes, or images, specify exact positioning and dimensions when possible. Ensure content does not overlap or spill outside the visible slide boundaries.

### 3. Presentation Updates
When modifying existing slides, carefully identify the target slide ID or index before applying changes. Do not delete slides or rearrange the presentation order without explicit instruction.
