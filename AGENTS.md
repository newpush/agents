# 🔐 Secrets & Configuration
This project follows a "Fetch-on-Demand" architecture for security (Phase 0 Security). All sensitive credentials (API keys, database URLs, etc.) are stored exclusively in an encrypted SecretOps platform (Infisical or 1Password Vaults) and are never written to disk or hardcoded in source code.

## Mandatory Security Rules

- NEVER ask the user for secrets in the chat interface.


- NEVER hardcode actual secret values in any files, `.env` files, or logs.


- ALWAYS use an Environment Injection CLI (`infisical run` or `op run`) to resolve credentials at runtime.


- RECOGNIZE REFERENCES: Any string starting with `op://` is a 1Password Secret Reference. You must use the CLI wrapper to resolve these into real values.

# 🚀 Execution Patterns
The Infisical/1Password CLI is pre-installed in the environment. When you need to execute scripts, tests, or servers that require credentials, you must wrap the command using the following pattern:

## Standard Command Wrapper
Use `infisical run` to dynamically pull the specified environment, or use the `--env-file` flag with `op run` and the project's `.env.template` to inject secrets directly into the process memory.

## Examples:


- Infisical Pattern (Python): `infisical run --env=dev -- python script.py`


- 1Password Pattern (NPM): `op run --env-file=.env.template -- npm test`


- Starting a Chat Session: `infisical run --env=dev -- gemini chat` 

# 🛠 Local Development & Authentication
When running on a local host, the system uses human SSO or Desktop App integration for authentication.


- Infisical: If execution fails, ensure you are logged in via `infisical login`.


- 1Password: If a command hangs or fails with an authentication error, it is likely waiting for the user to approve a TouchID, Windows Hello, or System Authentication prompt on their physical machine.

# 📝 Coding Standards
When writing code that requires configuration, always assume the values will be provided via process memory environment variables (e.g., `os.getenv()`). Do not create local `.env` parsing logic.
