## Overview
This file dictates how Gemini interacts with Google Docs via the MCP.

### 1. Document Creation & Formatting
When creating or formatting Google Docs, utilize standard structural elements (headings, paragraphs, lists) to ensure readability and proper document outline.

### 2. Content Modification
When appending or replacing text, ensure you are targeting the correct section of the document. Do not overwrite existing content unless explicitly instructed to do so. If the document is large, consider breaking updates into smaller, targeted operations.

### 3. Reading & Extraction
When reading documents, extract only the necessary context. For large documents, summarize the relevant sections rather than attempting to ingest the entire content at once.
