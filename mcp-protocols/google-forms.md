## Overview
This file dictates how Gemini interacts with Google Forms via the MCP.

### 1. Form Structure
When creating or modifying a form, ensure questions are clearly worded and utilize the appropriate input type (multiple choice, short answer, linear scale, etc.).

### 2. Response Handling
When reading or analyzing form responses, treat the data as structured output (often linked to a Google Sheet). Handle missing or malformed responses gracefully during analysis.
