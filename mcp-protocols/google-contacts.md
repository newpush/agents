## Overview
This file dictates how Gemini interacts with Google Contacts via the MCP.

### 1. Contact Management
When creating or updating contacts, ensure fields (name, email, phone, organization) are populated accurately. Avoid creating duplicate entries; search for existing contacts before adding a new one.

### 2. Privacy & Scope
Only access or modify contacts that are strictly relevant to the user's immediate request. Do not perform bulk exports or broad searches without clear authorization.
