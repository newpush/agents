# Pending Clarifications

This file now tracks only active, unresolved questions that still require product-owner input or an external artifact.

## Current Status

- There are no open product clarifications blocking the repository at this time.
- [2026-04-03] Resolved ROI Google Sheets Template URL (URL confirmed in `tools/roi/README.md`) and `logging-mcp` configuration scope (remains reference-only, not added to `mcp.config.json`).
- Durable answers from the March-April 2026 clarification backlog were normalized into [DECISION_LOG.md](DECISION_LOG.md), especially the entries dated `2026-04-02`.
- Questions that were superseded by implemented repo changes were closed as overtaken by events and removed from the active backlog.

## Template for New Questions

Add new questions below this line using the required format.

### ❓ Question [2026-04-02] - Node.js Resilience Helper Integration
**Context:** The `scripts/resilience_helpers.js` file exists and is mandated as a reference in `REQUIREMENTS.md`, but it is currently not utilized by the repository's core generation (`generate_all.js`) or audit tools (`audit-repo.js`).
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The core tools lack the exponential backoff resilience that the project mandates for agents.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should the `resilience_helpers.js` be integrated into the core repository scripts (`audit-repo.js`, `generate_all.js`) to satisfy the "Resilience" mandate within the repository's own tooling?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Refactor `scripts/audit-repo.js` and `scripts/generate_all.js` to use the `withRetry` helper for all filesystem operations.*

### ❓ Question [2026-04-02] - `logging-mcp` Activation Drift
**Context:** The `ROI Auditor` agent specification defines `logging-mcp` as a mandatory dependency for fleet-wide log ingestion, but the protocol is currently disabled (not present in `mcp.config.json`).
**Ambiguity / Drift:** The `ROI Auditor` cannot be fully validated as "active" in the current context files.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should `logging-mcp` be added to the default `active_mcps` list immediately to support Guardian agent development?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Update `mcp.config.json` to include "logging-mcp" in the `active_mcps` list and regenerate context.*

### ❓ Question [2026-04-02] - Legacy Example Labeling
**Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` Section 8 requires historical Python examples to be "clearly labeled as illustrative or legacy," but several examples (e.g., `examples/docker/`, `examples/video-automation-pod/`) lack these explicit headers.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** New builders may mistake legacy Python patterns for the canonical implementation path.
**Question for Product Owner:** Should Jules proceed with a bulk update to prepend "LEGACY/ILLUSTRATIVE" headers to all Python and Bash examples?
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Update all `.py` and `.sh` files in the `examples/` directory to include the mandatory "LEGACY/ILLUSTRATIVE" header.*

```md
### ❓ Question [YYYY-MM-DD] - Short Title
**Context:** Why this question exists and what file, workflow, or contract it relates to.
**Ambiguity / Drift:** What is unclear, contradictory, or externally blocked.
**Question for Product Owner:** The specific decision that still needs to be made.
**Answer:** [LEAVE BLANK FOR HUMAN TO FILL]
**🤖 Jules Action Prompt:** *Optional implementation prompt once the answer is known.*
