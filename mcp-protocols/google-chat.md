## Overview
This file dictates how Gemini interacts with Google Chat via the MCP.

### 1. Message Formatting
When sending messages to spaces or direct messages, utilize Google Chat's formatting capabilities (bold, italics, code blocks) to ensure readability.

### 2. Threading & Context
When replying to existing conversations, always ensure the reply is correctly threaded to maintain context. Do not start a new thread for an ongoing topic unless instructed.

### 3. Notification Management
Use `@mentions` judiciously. Only mention specific individuals or `@all` when the message requires immediate attention or action from those parties.
