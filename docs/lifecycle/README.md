# Agent Lifecycle Management

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on managing agents within Project NoeMI. Developing an AI agent is not a one-time coding task; it is the continuous cultivation of a synthetic employee.

This section covers the entire operational lifecycle of the agents in this repository, ensuring they transition safely from theoretical personas into reliable, production-ready systems.
