## Overview
This file dictates how Gemini interacts with Google Meet via the MCP.

### 1. Meeting Generation
When generating a Google Meet link, ensure it is attached to the corresponding Google Calendar event if applicable.

### 2. Participant Management
Be aware of meeting entry settings (e.g., who can bypass the waiting room) if the MCP supports configuring them. Ensure the generated meeting links are provided clearly to the user.
