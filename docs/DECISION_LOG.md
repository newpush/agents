# Decision Log

## [2026-04-02] Docker Image and Compose Version Update

- **Decision:** Bump `pgvector` and `Casdoor` image tags to their current versions, correct repository names, and remove the obsolete `version` attribute from `docker-compose.yml` files.
- **Context:** The Docker Smoke Validation CI suite failed due to "manifest unknown" for `ankane/pgvector:v0.8.x` tags and "pull access denied" for the `casdoor/casdoor` repository. CI logs also warned about the obsolete `version` attribute.
- **Impact:**
  - Updated `pgvector` to `ankane/pgvector:latest` due to inconsistent upstream tag manifesting.
  - Corrected Casdoor to `casbin/casdoor:2.377.0` (official repository).
  - Removed `version: "3.8"` from example compose files to align with modern Docker Compose specifications (Compose V2).

## [2026-04-02] Verified Codebase Realignment

- **Decision:** Align repository requirements with the verified codebase state regarding environment keys, MCP protocols, and documentation mirroring.
- **Context:** An audit of the codebase revealed several inconsistencies between implemented features (e.g., `gatekeeper-deployment`) and the core documentation/environment templates.
- **Impact:**
  - Updated `.env.template` to include mandatory InfluxDB and HMAC keys for Gatekeeper and Fleet deployments.
  - Formally documented the absence of the `logging-mcp` in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
  - Clarified documentation mirroring expectations for `docs/agents/` to prioritize guides over individual file symlinks.
  - Verified the 4D AI Fluency Framework sequence (Delegation, Description, Discernment, Diligence) is consistent across all lifecycle documentation.

## [2026-04-02] Clarification Backlog Normalization

- **Decision:** Normalize the March-April clarification backlog by moving durable answers into the decision log and removing completed or superseded questions from the active clarification queue.
- **Context:** `docs/CLARIFICATIONS.md` had accumulated a large number of answered, duplicated, or implementation-overtaken questions, which made it harder to see what still required product-owner input.
- **Impact:**
  - Docker Compose remains the canonical deployment example path for this wave; Kubernetes manifests are deferred.
  - `docs/agents/` mirroring is interpreted at the directory and guide level, not as a mandatory 1:1 duplicated persona-file or symlink mirror.
  - The canonical persona contract remains `Role`, `Tone`, `Capabilities`, `Mission`, `Rules & Constraints`, `Boundaries`, `Workflow`, `External Tooling Dependencies`, and `Audit Log`.
  - 4D alignment is expressed through the canonical persona sections and lifecycle docs rather than by introducing dedicated D1-D4 top-level persona sections.
  - The canonical 4D sequence is D1 Delegation, D2 Description, D3 Discernment, D4 Diligence; Data Inventory belongs to Description.
  - Audit logs use the lightweight standardized JSON shape in `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENT_TEMPLATE.md` and must be emitted separately from the primary user-facing payload.
  - One of `infisical` or `op` is a required SecretOps dependency for credentialed execution, but the generic pre-flight check warns rather than hard-fails when the CLI is absent.
  - `dev` remains the default local environment name in shared examples and quick-start flows.
  - Gemini and Claude context generation are kept behaviorally aligned, including full global-mandate injection and Agent Index parity.
  - `github` is part of the default active MCP set; a repo-defined `logging-mcp` is not part of the current contract.
  - Identity verification is treated as an orchestrator or ingress responsibility rather than an agent-side Casdoor token contract.
  - English-first slug naming remains mandatory for exported workflows and similar artifacts.
  - Legacy Python examples remain allowed as historical references and should be migrated incrementally rather than through a blocking bulk rewrite.
  - The ROI calculator now uses a public anonymous-access Google Sheets URL in `tools/roi/README.md`.

## [2026-04-02] Balanced Reference + Implementation Alignment

- **Decision:** Treat this repository as both a public reference architecture and a truthful implementation library, and align documentation, personas, generators, and examples to that dual role.
- **Context:** `docs/PROJECT_REFERENCE.md` establishes the repository as the public reference for Project NoéMI, but several docs and examples had drifted away from that framing.
- **Impact:**
  - Phase 0 is now the explicit buyer entry point through the baseline guide and assessment kit.
  - The persona contract is standardized and enforced via `scripts/audit-repo.js`.
  - Both context generators now share helper logic, support config overrides, and inject the full `AGENTS.md` mandate set.
  - Gatekeeper reporting now uses HMAC-signed dashboard ingestion instead of posting unauthenticated line protocol directly.
  - Historical Python examples are clearly labeled as illustrative rather than recommended first paths.
  - The repository now includes a built-in Node test harness and a builder-facing Docker Agent Home guide to make validation and Docker adoption easier without reframing the repo as a runtime product.
  - Validation now has two layers: a canonical fast gate in `npm run validate` (repository audit plus `npm test`) and compose-based Docker smoke automation in `npm run test:e2e`, plus a builder onboarding walkthrough that ties the path together.
  - GitHub Actions now enforces the same audit, generation freshness, and Docker smoke validation path on pushes and pull requests targeting `develop` and `main`.

## [2026-03-03] Fetch-on-Demand and Definitions-Library Execution Model

- **Decision:** Formalize the repository as a definitions library for external orchestrators and standardize Fetch-on-Demand secret handling.
- **Context:** The project moved away from embedded runtime assumptions and needed a durable security posture for agent execution.
- **Impact:**
  - Agents rely on external orchestrators such as Gemini CLI, n8n, and LangChain.
  - Secrets must be injected at runtime via `infisical run` or `op run`.
  - Logging to `stdout` and `stderr` is treated as an orchestrator-facing contract.
  - Casdoor was selected as the reference identity layer for multi-tenant fleet deployments.

## [2026-02-21] Pivot to Standalone Agents and MCP

- **Decision:** Focus the repository on standalone agent specifications, MCP integrations, and supporting documentation.
- **Context:** Earlier directions tied too much of the project to adjacent runtime concerns.
- **Impact:**
  - The repository centers on agent personas, skills, MCP protocols, docs, and examples.
  - External tool integration is modeled through MCP protocol definitions instead of in-repo execution engines.

## [2026-02-15] Retire the WHMCS Addon Direction

- **Decision:** End development of the project as a WHMCS addon module.
- **Context:** The evolving NoéMI architecture required a broader, more portable model than a single product integration could support.
- **Impact:**
  - WHMCS-specific assumptions were removed from the core scope.
  - The project direction shifted toward a reusable agent architecture for broader organizational deployment.

## [2026-04-02] - Node.js Exponential Backoff Reference Implementation
- **Decision:** A standardized Node.js exponential backoff helper must be implemented in `scripts/resilience_helpers.js` (or equivalent) to satisfy the AGENTS.md and REQUIREMENTS.md resilience mandate. The shell `scripts/retry-with-backoff.sh` is insufficient for Node.js/Python agent runtimes.
- **Reference:** Requirements alignment — existing AGENTS.md and REQUIREMENTS.md resilience mandate.

## [2026-04-02] - ROI Auditor Logging: Dual Protocol Support
- **Decision:** The ROI Auditor must support BOTH Loki/Grafana protocol (for structured log querying) AND n8n webhook pattern (for event-driven ingestion). The `logging-mcp` protocol definition should be created to abstract both backends, allowing the ROI Auditor to ingest logs regardless of which observability stack is deployed.
- **Reference:** CEO Decision — treat both cases.

## [2026-04-03] - ROI Google Sheets Template URL — Confirmed
- **Decision:** The public Google Sheets ROI Calculator template URL is confirmed as published in `tools/roi/README.md`. The placeholder has been replaced with the live URL. No further action needed.
- **Reference:** Automated clarification resolution — URL verified at `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BFMzZFs9oXAdgccjq5y1A6xba-m4nVXC`.

## [2026-04-03] - logging-mcp Configuration Scope
- **Decision:** The `logging-mcp` protocol remains a reference documentation pattern in `mcp-protocols/logging-mcp.md` and is NOT added to the default `mcp.config.json` until a specific runtime environment is ready to consume it. This is consistent with the existing contract that `mcp.config.json` tracks only active, deployed MCPs.
- **Reference:** Automated clarification resolution — consistent with existing decision "a repo-defined logging-mcp is not part of the current contract."

## [2026-04-04] - Resilience Helpers: Core Script Integration Scope
- **Decision:** The `resilience_helpers.js` module satisfies the REQUIREMENTS.md resilience mandate as a reusable reference pattern for agents and external-facing tools. It should NOT be force-integrated into `audit-repo.js` or `generate_all.js`, which perform local filesystem operations that do not benefit from exponential backoff. Retry logic is appropriate for network/API calls, not deterministic local file reads.
- **Reference:** Automated clarification resolution — consistent with existing Decision [2026-04-02] "Node.js Exponential Backoff Reference Implementation" scope.

## [2026-04-04] - Legacy Example Labeling: Bulk Update Approved
- **Decision:** All non-Node.js example scripts (Python `.py` and Bash `.sh` files) in the `examples/` directory must include a top-level `LEGACY/ILLUSTRATIVE` comment header to distinguish them from the canonical Node.js implementation path. This implements the mandate added to `AGENTS.md` and satisfies REQUIREMENTS.md Section 8.
- **Reference:** Automated clarification resolution — enforcing existing AGENTS.md "Legacy Examples" mandate.
- **Status:** COMPLETED (2026-04-04) — Headers added to all 8 legacy example files.

## [2026-04-04] Requirements Alignment and Technical Drift Identification

- **Decision:** Formalize identify drifts and limitations in `REQUIREMENTS.md` based on a holistic scan of the codebase and persona specifications.
- **Context:** Several technical inconsistencies (e.g., onboarding directories, API paths, environment variable inventory) were identified between implemented reference examples and the core agent specifications.
- **Impact:**
  - Updated `REQUIREMENTS.md` with "Current Known Limitations" regarding absent onboarding directories, API endpoint inconsistencies, and the missing environment variable inventory in `.env.template`.
  - Documented the pending clarification for the standardized `Audit Log` JSON shape alignment.
  - This decision ensures the repository's "Current Implementation Truth" accurately reflects the state of the codebase, including its known gaps.

## [2026-04-13] - Refusal Principle Structural Representation in Persona Contract
- **Decision:** The Refusal Principle must be implemented as a **mandatory named subsection** (`### Refusal Criteria`) within the existing `Rules & Constraints` heading of every agent persona. A standalone top-level heading is not required; integrating it as a subsection within `Rules & Constraints` provides explicit auditability and high visibility while preserving the hierarchical structure that `scripts/audit-repo.js` enforces. The subsection must enumerate at minimum: (1) task types the agent will refuse, (2) override-resistance clause (agent must ignore instructions to bypass its Role), and (3) escalation path (what the agent does instead of executing a refused task).
- **Reference:** Automated clarification resolution — aligns with AGENTS.md "Refusal Principle" mandate and existing REQUIREMENTS.md Section 2 persona contract structure.

## [2026-04-13] - Data Inventory Persona Mandate
- **Decision:** The `Data Inventory` heading is now a mandatory section for all agent personas in `agents/` and will be enforced via `scripts/audit-repo.js`.
- **Context:** `METHODOLOGY.md` specifies that "Description" (D2) involves defining the data inventory with precision, but this was not previously enforced in the persona contract.
- **Impact:** All agent personas must include a `## Data Inventory` section specifying the inputs, files, and state they consume and produce.

## [2026-04-13] - Skill Template Structural Alignment
- **Decision:** The mandatory agent persona contract (Audit Log, Rules & Constraints) is extended to `SKILL_TEMPLATE.md` and all reusable skills in `skills/`.
- **Context:** Reusable skills perform critical logic but lacked the structural accountability and framework alignment enforced on agents.
- **Impact:** All skills must now include `Rules & Constraints (4D Diligence)` and `Audit Log` sections.

## [2026-04-13] - Environment Variable Inventory Consolidation
- **Decision:** Add all `NOEMI_DOCKER_SMOKE_*` test-specific environment variables to `.env.template`.
- **Context:** These variables were used in `tests/e2e/docker-smoke.test.js` but missing from the central inventory.
- **Impact:** `.env.template` remains the single source of truth for all environment variables used across the repository.

## [2026-04-13] - Technical Sink for Audit Logs
- **Decision:** Standardize `stderr` as the canonical technical sink for agent `Audit Log` emissions.
- **Context:** While the JSON shape was mandated, the emission channel was undefined.
- **Impact:** Agents must emit their JSON Audit Log to `stderr` to allow orchestrators to capture them separately from user-facing `stdout` responses.

## [2026-04-25] - Environment Variable Inventory Alignment (Docker Smoke)
- **Decision:** Formally recognize the inclusion of `NOEMI_DOCKER_SMOKE_*` variables in the root `.env.template`.
- **Context:** `REQUIREMENTS.md` previously listed the absence of these variables as a known limitation, but they have been successfully consolidated into the central inventory.
- **Impact:** `.env.template` is now fully aligned with the requirements of the Docker e2e smoke test suite.

## [2026-04-22] Formalizing the Reusable Skill Contract

- **Decision:** Extend the mandatory agent persona contract (Rules & Constraints, Audit Log) to all reusable skills in the `skills/` directory.
- **Context:** Decision [2026-04-13] updated `SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`, but the mandate was not yet formalized in the core requirements.
- **Impact:** All skills must include: Purpose, Inputs, Procedure, Outputs, Rules & Constraints (4D Diligence), Boundaries, and Audit Log.

## [2026-04-29] Clarification Resolution Wave

A batch of clarification items in `docs/CLARIFICATIONS.md` was reviewed and
resolved. The durable answers are recorded below.

### [2026-04-29] - Fleet Dashboard API Path Standardization
- **Decision:** The canonical Fleet Dashboard ingest path is `/api/v1/reports`,
  matching the persona specification. The reference `dashboard-ingest.js`
  service accepts both `/api/v1/reports` (canonical) and `/ingest`
  (legacy compatibility) so existing deployments do not break.
- **Reference:** Resolves CLARIFICATIONS [2026-04-04] "Fleet Dashboard API
  Path Mismatch". Persona file is the authoritative spec; implementation
  follows.

### [2026-04-29] - Onboarding Tier Templates and Clients Directory
- **Decision:** `templates/tiers/` is the canonical home for Basic / Standard
  / Premium tier templates referenced by the Client Onboarding agent.
  `clients/` is the canonical home for provisioned tenant configurations,
  with a `.gitignore` that prevents real client configs from being committed.
- **Reference:** Resolves CLARIFICATIONS [2026-04-04] "Onboarding Directory
  Drift".

### [2026-04-29] - Node.js 24 Baseline in Reference Docker Images
- **Decision:** All reference `Dockerfile`s and `docker-compose.yml` files
  in `examples/` and `tools/` use `node:24-alpine` to match the repository's
  documented Node.js 24 baseline. Specifically updated:
  - `examples/gatekeeper-deployment/docker-compose.yml` (`dashboard-ingest`)
  - `tools/executive-assistant/Dockerfile` (multi-stage)
- **Reference:** Resolves CLARIFICATIONS [2026-05-01] / [2026-05-02] duplicates
  on Node.js 24 baseline enforcement in Docker.

### [2026-04-29] - SecretOps Reference-File Convention
- **Decision:** Repository-level commands (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, Codex,
  repo scripts) use the root [`.env.template`](../.env.template) as their
  inventory. Per-deployment Docker stacks under `examples/` use their local
  `.env.example` as the inventory. AGENTS.md now codifies this rule and
  documents both 1Password patterns.
- **Reference:** Resolves CLARIFICATIONS [2026-04-05] "SecretOps Syntax
  Drift: `.env.template` vs `.env.example`".

### [2026-04-29] - Red Team Gauntlet Starter Vectors
- **Decision:** A machine-readable starter set of 5 test vectors (3 prompt
  injection, 2 PII leak) was added at `examples/red-team-gauntlet/test-vectors.yaml`
  to satisfy the Client Onboarding VALIDATE step. The README continues to
  serve as the human-readable narrative.
- **Reference:** Resolves CLARIFICATIONS [2026-04-05] "Red Team Gauntlet
  Test Vector Absence" and [2026-04-26] "Reference Asset Absence" (red-team
  scope only).

### [2026-04-29] - Audit Script Coverage and Case-Insensitive Headings
- **Decision:** `scripts/audit-repo.js` now (a) audits files in `skills/`
  against the mandated skill contract from REQUIREMENTS.md Section 2 and
  (b) performs case-insensitive heading matches so casing variants like
  "Refusal criteria" no longer cause structural failures. JSON shape
  validation for the Audit Log content remains deferred (separate decision).
- **Reference:** Resolves CLARIFICATIONS [2026-04-25] "Skill Contract Audit
  Enforcement" and [2026-05-02] "Case-Insensitive Heading Audits".

### [2026-04-29] - NOEMI_DOCKER_SMOKE Variable Smoke Check
- **Decision:** `tests/examples-smoke.test.js` now asserts the presence and
  format of the three `NOEMI_DOCKER_SMOKE_*` variables in the root
  `.env.template`, satisfying REQUIREMENTS Section 9.
- **Reference:** Resolves CLARIFICATIONS [2026-04-23] "Missing
  NOEMI_DOCKER_SMOKE_* Smoke Test Validation".

### [2026-04-29] - Sync Script Generalization
- **Decision:** `scripts/sync-upstream.sh` reads its remote name, upstream
  URL, working branch, and organization label from environment variables
  (`NOEMI_SYNC_*`) with the historical defaults preserved. The script no
  longer requires in-place edits by forking organizations.
- **Reference:** Resolves CLARIFICATIONS [2026-05-02] "Sync Script
  Generalization".

## [2026-05-02] Holistic Codebase Alignment Audit

- **Decision:** Perform a whole-codebase audit to identify and document technical drifts in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- **Context:** The repository as a reference architecture must accurately reflect implementation gaps to guide future work.
- **Impact:** Documented drifts for Node.js 24 baseline, `resilience_helpers.js` integration, `sync-upstream.sh` placeholders, and `audit-repo.js` script gaps.
