# The 4D Framework: Delegation

## 1. The Core Principle
Delegation is the first and most critical phase of the AI lifecycle. It is the process of deciding **what** tasks should be given to an AI agent, and just as importantly, **what should not**.

In Project NoéMI, the "Refusal Principle" dictates that the most important delegation skill is knowing when a process requires human empathy, nuance, or judgment.

## 2. Goal and Platform Awareness
Before building an agent, you must define the acceptance criteria for a task (the "Definition of Done").
- **Stateless Query vs. Stateful Loop**: Are you asking a chatbot to answer a question once, or are you creating an autonomous agent to execute a workflow repeatedly over time?
- **Data Perimeter**: Classify the data types involved (Public, Internal, Confidential) before they touch an LLM.

## 3. The Delegation Process (High-Tech Surfboard Model)
- **Explorers (Passengers)**: Identify the "Business Pain Points" and define the "Why" without prescribing the technical solution. They own the problem.
- **Practitioners (Crew)**: Conduct a Data Inventory of the Explorers' requests, flagging unsafe data.
- **Accelerators (Pilots)**: Execute a Gartner AI TRiSM Assessment, review the Practitioners' inventory, and authorize the specific sandbox environment.
