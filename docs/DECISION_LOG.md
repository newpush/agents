# Decision Log

## [2026-03-03] - Resolved Questions Archive
### Question 2026-02-21 - Missing Support Helper and WHMCS MCP Components
- **Question:** Are the "Support Helper" persona and "WHMCS MCP" protocol documentation planned for this repository, or are they maintained in an external system?
- **Answer:** These components are planned for a future release and will be maintained in a separate specialized repository; this repository focuses on general-purpose agents and their MCP protocols.

### Question 2026-02-21 - Agent Execution Mechanism (Runner)
- **Question:** Is there an intended generic runner (e.g., a Python or Node.js script) that consumes these personas and the generated `GEMINI.md`, or is execution handled by an external orchestrator?
- **Answer:** Execution is handled by external orchestrators (e.g., Gemini CLI, n8n, LangChain). This repository is a definitions library to build and compose contexts, not an execution engine.

### Question 2026-02-21 - Documentation Mirroring Drift (`docs/agents/`)
- **Question:** Should the `docs/agents/` mirror be updated manually to match the current `agents/` structure, or is this mirroring requirement being deprecated?
- **Answer:** The `docs/agents/` mirror must be updated to match the `agents/` structure. The missing directories have been added.

### Question 2026-02-24 - Standardized Logging Implementation
- **Question:** Should agent personas be updated with a "Logging" section defining their output format, or is this requirement handled by the execution environment?
- **Answer:** This requirement applies to the external execution environment/orchestrator running the agents, not the persona definitions themselves.

### Question 2026-02-24 - Configuration Source of Truth
- **Question:** Should `mcp.config.json` be deprecated in favor of an `ACTIVE_MCPS` environment variable, or should the requirements be updated to recognize the JSON configuration as the source of truth?
- **Answer:** `mcp.config.json` is the source of truth for context assembly (generating GEMINI.md). Environment variables are the source of truth for runtime secrets.

### Question 2026-02-24 - Agent Resilience and Tool Failure Directives
- **Question:** Should a standardized "Error Handling" or "Resilience" section be added to all agent persona templates to guide their behavior during tool failures?
- **Answer:** A standardized "Error Handling and Resilience" directive will be added to the base templates or global guidelines rather than each individual persona.

### Question 2026-02-25 - Missing .env.template for Secret Resolution
- **Question:** Should a `.env.template` be added to the root directory, or is there another intended method for defining the required environment variable keys?
- **Answer:** A `.env.template` file should be added to the root directory documenting the required structure for orchestrator execution.

### Question 2026-02-25 - Python Runtime Environment Support
- **Question:** Is Python support planned for a future phase, and if so, what is the expected timeline or specific use case (e.g., specific agent runners)?
- **Answer:** This requirement is deprecated. The repository is a language-agnostic library of markdown specifications, and execution scripts are node-based utilities for context generation.

### Question 2026-02-25 - Consistent "NoeMI" Branding
- **Question:** Should "NoeMI" be adopted as the official branding across all documentation, or should it be removed from `REQUIREMENTS.md`?
- **Answer:** Yes, "Project NoéMI" is the official project branding and will be standardized across the README and other primary documentation.

### Question 2026-02-26 - Persona Template Standardization
- **Question:** Should all agents be migrated to the "Role, Tone, Capabilities, and Rules" format, or are there different classes of agents (e.g., "Standard" vs "Specialized/Task-Oriented") that require different templates?
- **Answer:** The "Role, Mission, Core Mandates, Workflow, Boundaries" format is adopted as the new standard for specialized agents. Simpler agents may continue using basic templates, but standardization towards the Bolt/Sentinel format is preferred.

### Question 2026-02-26 - Execution Context and Tooling References
- **Question:** Should agent personas be generic regarding their verification tools, or should they assume a specific runtime environment?
- **Answer:** Personas should document their expected external tooling dependencies in their requirements. They assume the orchestrator has prepared a compatible workspace.

### Question 2026-02-26 - Global Security Mandate Injection
- **Question:** Should the global security and execution mandates from `AGENTS.md` be automatically injected into `GEMINI.md` via the generation script, or should they be manually added to each agent's "Rules" section?
- **Answer:** Global security mandates should be included in `AGENTS.md` and injected by the orchestrator or `generate_gemini.js` into the final system prompt.

### Question 2026-02-27 - Stateless Execution vs. Persistent Memory Layer
- **Question:** Is the "Memory Layer" (pgvector) intended to be a core, required component of the Project NoéMI architecture, or is it an optional enhancement?
- **Answer:** The core execution model is stateless. The `pgvector` memory layer in the Docker example is an optional enhancement for advanced orchestrator setups.

### Question 2026-02-27 - Core Toolkit System Dependencies
- **Question:** Should `Docker` and the `Gemini CLI` be officially designated as core system requirements for the Project NoéMI toolkit?
- **Answer:** Docker and Gemini CLI are required dependencies for running the local examples and pre-flight checks, but not for simply reading the library definitions.

## [2026-02-28] - Comprehensive Documentation and Drift Resolution
- **Decision**: Answered all pending clarification questions and resolved documentation drifts.
- **Context**: Project required cleanup of requirements, branding standardization to "Project NoéMI", creation of `.env.template`, and clarifying the execution model (this is purely a definitions library for external orchestrators).
- **Impact**:
    - Created missing mirror directories in `docs/agents/`.
    - Added `.env.template` to the repository root.
    - Updated `REQUIREMENTS.md` to remove `[PENDING]` drifts and reflect updated consensus on stateless execution, standard persona templates, and removal of Python runtime requirements.
    - Updated `CLARIFICATIONS.md` with explicit answers.
    - Updated `README.md` to reflect Project NoéMI branding.

## [2026-02-21] - Pivot to Standalone Agents and MCP
- **Decision**: The repository is strictly for standalone scripts and agents. The "Support Helper" will be an agent that connects to a WHMCS MCP server.
- **Context**: Clarification provided that this is an agents repo, and any WHMCS features should rely on an MCP server instead of hosting module code.
- **Impact**: Removed `src/addonmodule.php`. Completely rewrote `REQUIREMENTS.md` and answered all pending questions in `CLARIFICATIONS.md`.

## [2026-02-21] - Resolved Architecture and Operational Clarifications
- **Decision**: Formally integrated architecture, security, and operational resolutions into `REQUIREMENTS.md`.
- **Impact**:
    - Verified that Auth/RBAC/Audit are delegated to the execution environment.
    - Standardized logging to `stdout`/`stderr`.
    - Confirmed stateless execution model.
    - Explicitly documented the pivot away from WHMCS PHP modules to standalone agents.
- **Resolved Questions**:
    - **New Platform/Architecture**: The repository is exclusively a collection of standalone AI agents and scripts. Support Helper will be a persona relying on external WHMCS MCP.
    - **Core Functionality Replacement**: No "Support Dashboard"; Support Helper uses MCP tools (cache clearing, status checks).
    - **Legacy Code Cleanup**: `src/addonmodule.php` removed.
    - **Legacy Configuration Fields**: Discarded. Config via env vars and 1Password.
    - **Undocumented Utility (Clear Cache)**: Handled by external WHMCS MCP tool.
    - **Performance Metrics**: Applies to agent response times, not a dashboard.
    - **Authentication Provider**: Delegated to execution environment (CLI/Orchestrator).
    - **Data Persistence**: Stateless execution; no relational DB required.
    - **Standardized Error Handling**: Use standardized logging to `stdout` and `stderr`.
    - **RBAC & Auditing**: Delegated to host platform or MCP server.
    - **Utility Extensibility**: Dynamic via Model Context Protocol (MCP).
    - **Target Runtime Environment**: Cross-platform (Node.js/Python), no longer PHP-specific.

## [2026-02-15] - Project Direction Pivot
