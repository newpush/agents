# Agent Lifecycle Management (The 4D Framework)

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on managing agents within Project NoéMI. Developing an AI agent is not a one-time coding task; it is the continuous cultivation of a synthetic employee.

This section covers the entire operational lifecycle of the agents in this repository, structured around the 4D AI Fluency Framework. This framework ensures agents transition safely from theoretical personas into reliable, production-ready systems, governed by the "High-Tech Surfboard" model (1 Pilot : 50 Passengers).
