#### Overview
This file dictates how agents interact with GitHub using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) and the GitHub REST/GraphQL APIs.

#### 1. Authentication
Always authenticate via environment variable `GH_TOKEN` injected at runtime through vault CLI wrappers (`op run` / `infisical run`). Never store tokens in config files or commit them to the repository.

#### 2. Rate Limit Awareness
Monitor `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers on every API response. When remaining calls drop below 100, introduce a backoff delay. On `403` or `429` responses, wait for the `X-RateLimit-Reset` timestamp before retrying.

#### 3. Pagination
Always paginate API responses. Use `--paginate` with `gh api` or follow `Link` headers in raw REST calls. Never assume a single page contains all results.

#### 4. Scope Minimization
Request only the scopes and data fields necessary for the current operation. Use GraphQL queries to select specific fields rather than fetching full objects via REST when possible.

#### 5. Audit Trail
Log every mutating API call (merge, close, comment, label) with the full request and response status for traceability. Include the agent identifier in all comments and commit messages.
