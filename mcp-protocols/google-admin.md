## Overview
This file dictates how Gemini interacts with the Google Workspace Admin Console via the MCP.

### 1. Extreme Caution
**CRITICAL:** Operations within the Admin Console have organization-wide impact. Proceed with extreme caution. Never execute actions that create, suspend, or delete users, or modify organization-wide settings (like domain routing or security policies) without explicit, multi-step confirmation from an authorized administrator.

### 2. Auditing & Logging
When performing administrative tasks, maintain a clear audit trail of actions taken, reasoning, and the specific IDs of users or groups affected.

### 3. Group Management
When managing Google Groups, carefully verify the email addresses being added or removed, and confirm the intended permission levels (Owner, Manager, Member) before applying changes.
